# 🔧 Webhook Issue Fix Guide

## Issue Identified ✅
Prepaid payments are successful in Razorpay but not creating Qikink orders because **webhooks are not being triggered/processed**.

## Root Cause Analysis 🔍

### Orders are stuck at:
- Status: `payment_verified` 
- Payment: `verified`
- Method: `razorpay`

### They should progress to:
- Status: `paid` → `confirmed`
- Payment: `paid`

## Immediate Fix Applied ✅

**Manual Fix Successful**: All 4 stuck orders processed and sent to Qikink:
- Order 13355493312 ✅
- Order 13355498016 ✅  
- Order 13355502720 ✅
- Order 13355507424 ✅

## Permanent Solution 🛠️

### Option 1: For Production Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Deploy to production** (Netlify/Vercel)
2. **Update Razorpay webhook URL** to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/razorpay`
3. **Webhooks will work automatically** in production

### Option 2: For Local Development  
1. **Use ngrok** temporarily for webhook testing:
   ```bash
   npx ngrok http 3000
   ```
2. **Update Razorpay webhook URL** to: `https://xyz.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/razorpay`

### Option 3: Alternative Flow (Backup)
Modify the payment verification endpoint to handle Qikink creation directly without waiting for webhook.

## Current Status 📊
- ✅ Payment processing works
- ✅ Order creation works  
- ✅ Qikink integration works
- ❌ Webhook not triggering (local development limitation)
- ✅ Manual processing successful

## Recommended Action 🎯
**Deploy to production** - This will solve the webhook issue permanently since Razorpay will be able to reach your production webhook URL.

## For Immediate Testing 🧪
If you need to test more prepaid orders locally, run:
```bash
node fix-stuck-orders.js
```

This will automatically process any stuck prepaid orders and send them to Qikink.
