# Strict Email and Username Validation Implementation

## Overview
Implemented strict validation for both manual registration and Google OAuth to ensure unique emails and usernames, with proper error messages when duplicates are found.

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. Manual Registration API (`/api/user/route.ts`)
**Enhanced Error Messages:**
- Email conflict: "An account with this email address already exists. Please use a different email or try signing in."
- Username conflict: "This username is already taken. Please choose a different username."
- Added `field` property to identify which field caused the conflict

### 2. Google OAuth Flow (`lib/auth.ts`)
**Custom PrismaAdapter:**
- Strict validation before user creation
- No automatic username generation (enforces uniqueness)
- Clear error messages for conflicts:
  - Email: "An account with the email address '[email]' already exists. Please sign in instead of creating a new account."
  - Username: "The username '[username]' is already taken. Please contact support to resolve this issue."

**Updated signIn Callback:**
- Email normalization for consistency
- Existing user detection
- Allows sign-in for existing users, blocks creation for conflicts

### 3. Error Handling (`app/auth/error/page.tsx`)
**Custom Error Page:**
- User-friendly error display
- Specific guidance for OAuth errors
- Action buttons (retry, go home)
- Solutions and troubleshooting tips

## ðŸ”’ Validation Rules

### For Manual Registration:
1. **Email uniqueness**: Checked against both `users` and `pendingUsers` tables
2. **Username uniqueness**: Checked against both `users` and `pendingUsers` tables
3. **Email normalization**: Applied to prevent duplicate accounts
4. **Clear error messages**: Specify which field is causing the conflict

### For Google OAuth:
1. **Email uniqueness**: Must be unique in the database
2. **Username uniqueness**: Google display name must be unique
3. **No automatic fallbacks**: Forces user to resolve conflicts manually
4. **Existing user sign-in**: Allows existing users to sign in normally

## ðŸš« What Will Be Rejected

### Manual Registration:
- Email that exists in any form (including normalized versions)
- Username that already exists
- Both will return HTTP 409 with specific error messages

### Google OAuth:
- Email that already exists â†’ Error page with sign-in suggestion
- Username (display name) that already exists â†’ Error page with support contact
- Both scenarios redirect to `/auth/error` with explanatory messages

## ðŸ“± User Experience

### Successful Cases:
- **New manual registration**: Account created with email verification
- **New Google OAuth**: Account created and immediately signed in
- **Existing user Google OAuth**: Signs in to existing account

### Error Cases:
- **Manual registration conflicts**: Form shows field-specific error
- **Google OAuth conflicts**: Redirected to error page with solutions
- **Clear guidance**: Users know exactly what to do next

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Test Manual Registration:
1. Try registering with existing email â†’ Should show email error
2. Try registering with existing username â†’ Should show username error
3. Try registering with new email/username â†’ Should succeed

### Test Google OAuth:
1. Sign in with Google (existing account) â†’ Should sign in successfully
2. Try Google OAuth with existing email â†’ Should show error page
3. Try Google OAuth with existing display name â†’ Should show error page
4. Try Google OAuth with completely new details â†’ Should create account

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files Updated:
- `app/api/user/route.ts` - Enhanced manual registration validation
- `lib/auth.ts` - Custom adapter and strict OAuth validation
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - New error handling page

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits:
1. **Data integrity**: Guarantees unique emails and usernames
2. **Clear feedback**: Users know exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
3. **Consistent experience**: Same validation rules for all registration methods
4. **Better UX**: Proper error pages instead of technical error messages
5. **Security**: Prevents account conflicts and unauthorized access
